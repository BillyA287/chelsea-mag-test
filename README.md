Create a Simple To-Do List Application

 # Deliveriables 
 1. HTML Structure
- Create a basic HTML structure for the to-do list application, including:
- An input field for adding new to-do items.
- A button to submit the new to-do item.
- A list to display existing to-do items.
- Each to-do item should have a checkbox for marking it as complete and a delete button.
2. CSS Styling
- Style the to-do list application to make it visually appealing.
- Include hover effects for when a user hovers over a list item
3. JavaScript Functionality
- Implement JavaScript functionality to:
- When the checkbox is checked, make the colour of the item text grey / strike-through
- When the submit button is pressed, add a confirm dialogue (it doesnâ€™t have to actually submit anything)
